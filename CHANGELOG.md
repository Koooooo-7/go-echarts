# Feature

There is the new v2 landed on the earth !

## Static file package

As far as I know, there is no a good practice of packing static files into binary file.
So, we refactor the templates to make it possible that you need not extra import the templates.

## Upgrade API

Now you have the more flexible API to config your charts.
- Standard API : `SeriesOpts`, `GlobalOpts`.
- Custom configuration.
- More semantic interface.

## Chart Type

- Add more chart types : `Timeline`,`Grid`
- Add more supports for map

## Render

- Custom hooks
  Now, you can handle the render in your own way.
  
- More configurations
  More configuration for the charts.
  
## Document

- More useful demos.
- Perfect EN document.
